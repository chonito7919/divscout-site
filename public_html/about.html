            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>DivScout aims to provide investors and researchers with reliable, validated dividend payment data extracted directly from official SEC EDGAR filings. By processing XBRL data and applying intelligent quality checks, we create a clean database of historical dividend information.</p>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Data Quality</h2>
            <p>Our confidence scoring system evaluates each dividend record based on multiple factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detection and filtering of annual totals vs. individual payments</li>
                <li>Validation of payment dates and amounts</li>
                <li>Identification of potential data quality issues</li>
                <li>Only high-confidence records (â‰¥0.8 score) displayed by default</li>
            </ul>
